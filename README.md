# HORANVIM
Configurations planning to be just enough and elegant :)

# Installation
## Clone the configs
``` bash
$ mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak # backup the previous configurations
$ git clone https://github.com/horanmustaplot/horanvim.git ~/.config/nvim # Git horanvim configs and put them in the config folder for neovim
$ rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git # Remove the .git folder
```
## Run and code!
``` bash
$ nvim # Run neovim and ley lazy to install plugins, then start coding!
```
# Notes
- I still beginner in doing so
  I'm looking for a lotta of issues, and it's gonna be my pleasure to build a good just enought configurations for NVIM

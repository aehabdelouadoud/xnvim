# Installation
## Clone the configs
``` bash

$ git clone https://github.com/horanmustaplot/horanvim.git ~/.config/nvim # Git horanvim configs and put them in the config folder for neovim
$ rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git # Remove the .git folder
```
## Run and code!
``` bash
$ nvim # Run neovim and get install plugins, then start coding!
```
